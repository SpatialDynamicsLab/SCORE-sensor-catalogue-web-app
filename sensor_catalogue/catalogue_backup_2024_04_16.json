In the last few years some SCORE partners (MBI, UNIPI, LAMMA, CNR, PROGECOM) worked on innovative methods to use this device as a rain probe: by measuring the attenuation of the signal received by the IST from the satellite, through a patented algorithm, it is possible to get an estimation of the rain rate in almost realtime. The estimate is quite accurate at both low and high rain rates, which makes it a convenient solution for rain monitoring with estimates comparable to professional much more expensive sensors. In addition, the IST provides a communication channel, that can be used to send data from other sensors.

It is distinguished by its sturdiness and low cost. This 2-axis ultrasonic wind sensor requires no maintenance, a factor that makes it a veritable lowcost alternative to the traditional sensors equipped with vanes or propellers, with all the benefits of ultrasound technology. Since it has no moving parts, it is ideal for use in adverse weather conditions.\r\nWSG is able to provide wind velocity and direction data through one serial output or two analogue outputs. In order to confirm proper operation, the outputs are jointly transmitted to a string with an instrumentation status code. WSG was designed with a corrosion-proof polycarbonate structure that also makes it very lightweight and easy to transport.\r\n\r\nOPERATION\r\nWSG measures the time an ultrasonic pulse takes to travel from the north transducer to the south transducer, and compares it with the time necessary for a pulse to travel in the opposite direction, that is to say, from the south transducer to the north transducer. The times are compared in the same way between the west and east transducers. The wind velocity and direction can be calculated by the differences in flight time on each axis. This calculation is independent from factors such as temperature and humidity.\r\n\r\nMAIN FEATURES\r\n- Construction materials:\r\nThis sensor is designed with a corrosion-proof polycarbonate structure that makes it very lightweight and easy to transport. With a true solid-state construction, WSG can be used in harsh environmental conditions without fear of damages often associated with cup or propeller sensors. WSG is suitable for a wide range of wind monitoring applications and is particularly appropriate for marine and offshore use (ships, buoys, beacons), as well as for land installations. With its exterior made of corrosion-proof material and with no moving parts, this ultrasonic wind sensor eliminates the need for costly on-site maintenance, especially in remote and hard to access stations.\r\n- Easy maintenance:\r\nOwing to its measurement principle that requires no moving mechanical parts, a Sonic Anemometric sensor is less subject to malfunctions and the replacement of components than its mechanical competitors.\r\n- Sturdy and reliable construction:\r\nlastly makes it an instrument with a long lifetime, which safeguards the customer’s investment. The instrument does not drift due to aging and requires no periodic calibrations.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE\r\nGenerally speaking, wind reading instruments have to be able to take measurements of the wind conditions in a vast area.\r\nIn order to get a good reading of the velocity of the horizontal component of wind motion, the device has to be installed in an area free of obstacles for at least 10 metres.\r\nFree area means that the transducer must be placed at least 10 times the height of the closest obstacle. If this is not possible, the sensor must be installed at a height such that the nearby obstacles do not affect the measurement of the wind velocity taken. The transducer must be place in the centre of any vegetation at the site, and not on one side. This is to prevent privileged directions from being created in the reading. The sensor must be secured in a perfectly horizontal position, ensured using a spirit level, to prevent water from seeping into the instrument. Lastly, in view of its construction and principle of measurement, it is totally maintenance-free.\r\n\r\nWIND VELOCITY MEASUREMENT:\r\nSensor type (WV): Ultrasonic measurement device\r\nMeasurement range: 0-60 m/s\r\nAccuracy ± 2% @ 12 m/s\r\nOutput: Various options RS232, SDI12, etc.\r\nOperative temperature: -35°C ... + 70°C\r\n\r\nWIND DIRECTION MEASUREMENT:\r\nSensor type (WD): Ultrasonic measurement device\r\nMeasurement: 0-359°C\r\nAccuracy: ± 2% @ 12 m/s\r\nOutput: Various options RS232, SDI12, etc.\r\nOperative temperature: -35°C ... + 70°C", "relevant_to_models": false, "relevant_to_ewss": true, "price": "950.00", "sensor_website": "https://www.etgsrl.it/en/products/wsg-wind-velocity-and-direction/", "project_name": "", "project_year": null, "project_website": null, "reference_paper": "", "accuracy": "± 2% @ 12 m/s", "unit_of_measurement": "Wind velocity: m/s; Wind direction: degrees", "data_refresh_time": null, "wifi_connection": false, "mobile_data_connection": false, "number_of_components": 1, "external_power_supply": true, "minimum_purchase_quantity": 1, "spatial_density_per_area": null, "spatial_density_distribution": "Not provided", "purchase_operation": 11, "assembly_operation": 8, "assembly_operation_public_involvement": "Limited", "deployment_operation": 4, "deployment_operation_public_involvement": "Limited", "deployment_costs": 3, "data_analysis_operation": 8, "data_analysis_public_involvement": "Limited", "citizen_science_operation": 9, "targeted_user": "Local groups; local authorities", "image": "sensor_images/2024/02/15/ETG_WSG_Anemometer_1.jpg", "slug": "wsg-sonic-anemometer", "published": true, "monitored_parameter": [10, 11], "hazard": [5], "hazard_category": [2], "hazard_specific": [2]}}, {"model": "catalogue.sensor", "pk": 40, "fields": {"id_old": "", "tested_with_score": false, "reference_partner": "MBI srl", "sensor_name": "BP260 Pressure Sensor", "short_description": "Liquid-free aneroid barometer, based on the balance between the pressure exercised by the atmosphere and the elastic forces developed by bodies with a specially studied geometry, whose changes in shape translate into a measurable elastic action.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: this sensor needs to be connected to an external data logger unit to collect the generated data.", "full_description": "Operation of the liquid-free aneroid barometers is based on the balance between the pressure exercised by the atmosphere and the elastic forces developed by bodies with a specially studied geometry, whose changes in shape translate into a elastic action that counterbalances the atmospheric action.\r\n\r\nOPERATION\r\nThe extent of this deformation, converted into an electric signal and properly amplified, represents the value of the atmospheric pressure.

These probes are made up of a perfectly fluid-sealed sensitive part and an electrical cable that transmits the signal outside the immersion zone.

The resistance and compatibility with the fluids of the various components, type of material the instrument case, seals and electrical cable are made of are essential\r\nin this application. Titanium probes can be supplied for off-shore and naval applications as they are excellent for resistance to saline corrosion. The PLS sensor takes the measurement of the level of a waterway or water basin by measuring the pressure exercised by the liquid column above and referring it to the atmospheric pressure, so it is an instrument that takes measurements of differential pressure.\r\n\r\nOPERATION\r\nThe sensor is based on a sensitive piezoresistive element made up of 4 resistors with bridge structure spread on a silicon wafer. The transducer is contained inside a watertight chamber filled with oil and closed by a stainless steel membrane on which the external liquid exercises pressure; the cell refers to the atmospheric pressure from a compensation tube integrated in the cable. The case is in stainless steel, sealed for immersion up to 50 metres.\r\n\r\nMAIN FEATURES\r\n- Complete customisation :\r\nThe sensor in question can be supplied with customised precisions, flow rate, cable length and case material; for example, it can be made in materials particularly resistant to corrosive agents for marine applications.\r\n- Easy maintenance:\r\nNormally housed inside surge pipes, the sensor can be easily maintained and is easy to safely recover out of the water. \r\n-Sturdy and reliable construction:\r\nThis makes it an instrument with a long lifetime, which safeguards the customer’s investment.

An antenna system radiates very short microwave pulse on the surface of the water that will be reflected and again picked up by the antenna system. The pulses propagate at the speed of light and the round trip time from emission to reception of the signal is proportional to the liquid level.

The sensitive surface of the thermopile is covered with opaque black paint which allows the pyranometer not to be selective at the various wavelengths. The spectral range of the pyranometer is determined by the transmission of the two glass domes type K5. The radiant energy is absorbed by the blackened surface of the thermopile, thus creating a temperature difference between the\r\ncenter of the thermopile (hot junction) and the body of the pyranometer (cold junction). The temperature difference between the hot junction and the cold junction is converted into a potential difference thanks to the Seebeck effect.

The fixing on a surface can be performed using the two holes with a diameter of 6 mm and a distance of 65 mm.\r\n• The installer must take care that the height of the support pole does not exceed the plane of the pyranometer, so as not to introduce measurement errors caused by reflections and shadows caused by the pole.\r\n• It is preferable to thermally insulate the pyranometer from its support, and at the same time make sure that there is a good electrical contact to ground.\r\n\r\nIn the event that the sensor, during the maintenance phase, is found to be out of tolerance, it will have to be calibrated.\r\n\r\nCOMPONENTS THAT CAN BE ADDED TO OR BE BUILT INTO THE PRODUCT\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\r\nRange: 0-2000 W/m2\r\nSpectral field: 305 nm-2800nm\r\nSensitivity: 10 uV/ (W/m2)\r\nOutput: 4-20 mA\r\nOperative temperature: -40° C ... +80°C\r\nField of view: 2 π sr", "relevant_to_models": true, "relevant_to_ewss": false, "price": "2950.00", "sensor_website": "https://www.etgsrl.it/en/products/global-radiation-cm6b/", "project_name": "", "project_year": null, "project_website": null, "reference_paper": "", "accuracy": null, "unit_of_measurement": "W/m2", "data_refresh_time": null, "wifi_connection": false, "mobile_data_connection": false, "number_of_components": 1, "external_power_supply": true, "minimum_purchase_quantity": 1, "spatial_density_per_area": null, "spatial_density_distribution": "Not provided", "purchase_operation": 11, "assembly_operation": 9, "assembly_operation_public_involvement": "Limited", "deployment_operation": 6, "deployment_operation_public_involvement": "Limited", "deployment_costs": 3, "data_analysis_operation": 8, "data_analysis_public_involvement": "Limited", "citizen_science_operation": 9, "targeted_user": "Local groups; local authorities", "image": "", "slug": "cm6b-pyranometer-sensor", "published": false, "monitored_parameter": [17], "hazard": [6], "hazard_category": [2], "hazard_specific": [8, 10]}}, {"model": "catalogue.sensor", "pk": 47, "fields": {"id_old": "", "tested_with_score": false, "reference_partner": "MBI srl", "sensor_name": "R102 Pluviometre", "short_description": "The pluviometric sensor, consisting of a collector funnel with a usable surface and a pair of swinging tanks, complies with the precision requirements, both low density and high density of rain, of the WMO standards. A spherical bubble, an integral part of the sensor, allows the sensor to be properly levelled.\r\nThe surface treatment of the funnel guarantees that no drops stagnate. Furthermore, filters placed in the funnel and on the drains prevent foreign objects or insects from depositing in the tanks and obstructing the regular flow of rain. The external treatment of the pluviometre container minimises losses due to evaporation.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: this sensor needs to be connected to an external data logger unit to collect the generated data.", "full_description": "OPERATION\r\nThe R102 pluviometric sensor measures the precipitation collected by a circular orifice (funnel-shaped) calibrated 1000 cm², supplying a signal for every one-fifth millimetre of fallen water (20 g).\r\nThe sensitive element is made up of a pair of swinging tanks; the central oscillation pin consists of two stainless steel knives resting on a Teflon support. The water collected by the funnel is guided to the empty tank situated near the orifice outlet by a drain, while the other serves as a counterweight to prevent it from filling. The system is calibrated so that the full tank turns downwards to empty after one-fifth of a millimetre of water has fallen, and the other rises to position itself under the calibrated orifice. A magnet passes in front of a “reed” contact with each swing of the tanks to close it.\r\n\r\nMAIN FEATURES\r\n- Correction algorithm:\r\nSince the transit time between the loading position of one tank and the other is not zero, the datalogger with a specific software stratagem compensates the water quantity that continues to fall into the full tank before the other reaches the loading position based on the rainfall intensity. Special mechanical stratagems have also been adopted to increase the transit speed and to reduce the distance between the tank loading positions.\r\n\r\n- Easy maintenance:\r\nThe benefits offered by this pluviometric sensor are not limited to precision, but also include simplicity and speed of maintenance. In fact, the internal platform scale unit is accessed by unscrewing the three screws that block the shell on the aluminium cylindrical base. The swinging tank instead is quickly removed from the oscillation base with simple rotation. In this way the cleaning is much easier, can be properly performed on the entire platform scale, and all impurities can be removed.\r\n\r\n- Sturdy and reliable construction:\r\nThis makes it an instrument with a long lifetime, which safeguards the customer’s investment.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\nThe calibrated orifice must be positioned horizontal with the ground. A template with four stud bolts is embedded on a cement plinth, to which the base of the post supporting the pluviometre is anchored. The R102 pluviometric sensor will be installed using a sturdy hot-galvanised steel post 1.4 metres tall, 60 mm in diameter and 5 mm thick, supported by a special concrete base and connected to the control unit using reinforced sheaths. The minimum distance between pluviometre and the first close-by obstacle higher than the pluviometre must be twice the difference of the heights of the two. Where possible, it is always best to avoid a situation with vegetation surrounding the pluviometre, even if lower, because it can create whirlwinds. \r\nThe distance of the control unit must be no greater than 500 metres. The sensor does not drift due to aging and requires no periodic calibrations. It is periodically necessary to clean the greasing filter of the water and tanks, and check the levelling of the sensor base. Since it is totally passive, the sensor is not sensitive to electronic discharges.\r\n\r\nCOMPONENTS THAT CAN BE ADDED OR BE BUILT INTO THE PRODUCT\r\nFor the pluviometres also affected by snowfall, the cylinder has an internal coating that reduces heat exchange between inside and outside; a set of heaters are also activated when the external temperature is lower than 4°C so that the snow dissolves in the water when heated in the funnel.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\r\nSensor type: Tank Swinging\r\nCollection orifice: 1000 cm2\r\nMeasurement range: 0-300 mm/h\r\nResolution: 0,2 mm\r\nOverall precision: ±3%\r\nConnection with datalogger: 0-5 reed switch contact", "relevant_to_models": false, "relevant_to_ewss": true, "price": "2500.00", "sensor_website": "https://www.etgsrl.it/en/products/r102-rain/", "project_name": "", "project_year": null, "project_website": null, "reference_paper": "", "accuracy": "±3%", "unit_of_measurement": "mm/h", "data_refresh_time": null, "wifi_connection": false, "mobile_data_connection": false, "number_of_components": null, "external_power_supply": true, "minimum_purchase_quantity": 1, "spatial_density_per_area": null, "spatial_density_distribution": "Not provided", "purchase_operation": 11, "assembly_operation": 8, "assembly_operation_public_involvement": "Limited", "deployment_operation": 2, "deployment_operation_public_involvement": "Limited", "deployment_costs": 2, "data_analysis_operation": 8, "data_analysis_public_involvement": "Limited", "citizen_science_operation": 9, "targeted_user": "Single citizens; local groups; local authorities", "image": "sensor_images/2024/02/15/R102_Pluviometre_1.jpg", "slug": "r102-pluviometre", "published": true, "monitored_parameter": [4], "hazard": [4], "hazard_category": [1], "hazard_specific": [6]}}, {"model": "catalogue.sensor", "pk": 48, "fields": {"id_old": "", "tested_with_score": false, "reference_partner": "MBI srl", "sensor_name": "iMoisture - Soil Moisture Sensor", "short_description": "The iMoisture is a smart sensor for volumetric water content (VWC) in soil (“Soil Moisture”) with wireless transmission of the data to a gateway or directly to the Internet (IOT - Internet of Things).

The adaptability of the sensor also extends to the applications on which this sensor can be used to perform smart maintenance of lawns for sports use, to prevent fungal plant diseases in crops, and much more.\r\n- Long battery lifetime:\r\nThe operational lifetime is guaranteed for 12 months using a type D battery in the case of daily data transmission.\r\n- Sturdy and reliable construction:\r\nUt makes it an instrument with a long lifetime, which safeguards the customer’s investment.\r\n- Flexibility:\r\nThe sensor can comprise one or more measuring heads and be installed at different depths. In this way it can reach the root systems of any crop and hence allow the iMoisture sensor to be used standard in any crop.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\nThe sensor is easily installed in the soil by removing a 10 cm diameter core from it slightly higher than the sensor. The instrument is totally inserted while taking care to place part of the soil removed on its sides and on top, and lastly a signal picket is placed in the immediate vicinity.

The instrument consists of a “PT100 CI.A” thermistor according to the DIN 43760 standards to measure air temperature and a capacitive type of sensor to measure the relative humidity, consisting of a membrane of hygroscopic material that forms the dielectric of a capacitor so that the water molecules in the air are absorbed by the dielectric, thus causing a change in the capacitor’s capacity, due to the humidity, to which a change in the oscillation frequency of an electrical circuit connected to a sensor corresponds, which\r\nin turn transforms it into a change in direct voltage. The probe produces a signal/noise ratio.\r\n\r\nMAIN FEATURES\r\n- Protective devices:\r\nThe sensor is equipped with fast semiconductor electronic devices for protection from electric discharges.\r\n\r\n- Easy maintenance:\r\nThe benefits that our thermohygrometric sensor offers are not limited to precision, but also include simple and quick maintenance due to the engineering of the sensor that simplifies the phases.
